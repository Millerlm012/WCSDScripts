# WCSDScripts
I am a field technician at the Waukee Community School District. These are the various programs / scripts I've written for the district to make my life and my co-worker's lives easier.
I have a couple other projects that are in private repositories as they are still in development.

- there is a README.md in each folder for the containing projects.
